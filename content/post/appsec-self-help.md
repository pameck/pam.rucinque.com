Application security (AppSec) is like an onion, you have to have multiple layers to protect your application and users against attacks, it is not a single practice or switch you turn on that will protect it but the multiple layers you use to make it harder for the evil people on the internet. <!--more-->

**Understanding how the attacks work is quite important to defend your applications and users.**

I have a terrible memory. And more often than not, I found myself going again through the reasoning behind certain security practices, features and concepts. I don't spend my days attacking websites, or dealing with security issues, I forget the details around how some of these things work! And that's fine, I can live with that, but I'll try to fix it.

I am going to (try to) write about every security thing I have to revisit, so the next time I forget the specifics I don't have to google a million things again but instead come back to these posts and hope they make sense!

Because a lot of the software I write is for Web Applications, I'm expecting the posts to be very much related to Web Security.

So, here it is the first one: [SOP - Same Origin Policy](/post/appsec-self-help-sop)
