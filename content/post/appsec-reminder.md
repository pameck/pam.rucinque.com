I have a terrible memory. And more often than not, I found myself going again through the reasoning behind certain security practices, features and concepts. I don't think that much as the attacker, I'm not dealing with security issues on a daily basis, so I forget how attacks work! And that's fine, I can live with that. But since I like knowing why things work the way they do, I decided to write this series of posts, so I can come back to them, and re-read them the next time I need to.  <!-- more -->

Application security (AppSec) is like an onion, you have to have multiple layers to protect your application and **users** against attacks, it is not a single practice or switch you turn on that will protect them but the multiple layers you use to make it harder for the evil people on the internet.

Understanding how the attacks work is quite important to defend your applications and users from them. So in the following posts I'll describe AppSec-related concepts in the context of an attack and how they help to prevent any harm the attack can cause. This will be an ongoing series, so I expect this list of topics to grow.
