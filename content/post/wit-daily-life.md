### Scene 1

- Guy: team, louse coupling all the time
- Team: oh yeah, yes, louse coupling is the best

### Scene 2
- Woman: team, louse coupling all the time
- Dev: why?
- Woman: well, because it allows you to change parts of the code without having to change it all.
- Dev: hmmm, and what about \<insert super obscure exception\>
- Woman: yes, thatâ€™s an exception. For the other times, louse coupling is a must.
- Dev: right, so what _you really meant_ was louse coupling *most* of the times.
- Woman: sigh.
